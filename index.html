        DJ Ruck is from Ames, IA. From a very young age, Ruck was infatuated with music and would constantly be listening to it. For his 13th birthday, he was gifted ‘Straight Outta Compton’ – N.W.A from his Father. From there Ruck explored many areas of Hip Hop and became immersed in its history along with its current rise on the forefront of music. Fast-forward to college, Ruck found himself often being asked to play his selection of music at house parties at Iowa State University, where he attended college. It was then he bought his first DJ Deck, the Hercules RMX 2. After practicing, he was given a shot at Cy’s Roost on the fateful night of the Ames Veishea Riots 2014. From there, his success grew and skill grew. Over the next year he acquired, 4 Weekly Residencies in Ames: Paddy’s Irish Pub, Mickey’s, Cy’s Roost FAC, and The District. Along with that, DJ Ruck has done a multitude of different events ranging from: fashion shows, magazine release parties, sorority formals, corporate events, and weddings. He is no stranger to big crowds either. In Fall of 2014 Ruck DJ’d ‘Hilton Madness’, which was an opener event for the Iowa State Basketball team. Over 8,000 people were in attendance. He has also opened for the up and coming EDM duo, Milk n’ Cookies.
